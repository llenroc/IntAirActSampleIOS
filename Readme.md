# IntAirActImageIOS

An iOS App using IntAirAct.

## What does it do?

Watch a pretty lame [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vExBuGvAyB8) that shows it.

It's a simple local photo sharing application to demonstrate IntAirAct's features. It allows you to browse the images of other devices running the app on your Wi&#8209;Fi.

If you swipe upwards when looking at an image it will send the image to all the devices available - including the [OS X](https://github.com/ase-lab/IntAirActSampleOSX) version.

## How do I run it?

*   Clone or [download](https://github.com/ase-lab/IntAirActSampleIOS/archive/master.zip) the project
*   Install cocoapods if necessary with `gem install cocoapods`
*   `pod install`
*   `open IntAirActImageIOS.xcworkspace`
*   Run it :-)
